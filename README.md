CTParticles
===========
This is a particles plugin I wrote to learn how to do particles. This git is now deprecated as I am rewriting the plugin from scratch and I don't have a very good git client, so I may update the code here, but for the time being I'm freesing this repo. The code for the plugin won't be obfuscated, so you are welcome to look at it there once I rewrite it.

This is on the Spigot website (spigotmc.org).

This is intended for use with CraftBukkit/Spigot
